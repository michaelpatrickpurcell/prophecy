# Prophecy: A tabletop roleplaying game about fate and destiny.

This is draft version 1.1.

See the [rules pages](prophecy_pages.pdf) for a typeset version of the rules designed to be read on screens. In this version, the section names that appear in the text are hyperlinks to the target sections of the rules.

See the [rules booklet](prophecy_booklet.pdf) for a version of the rules that can be printed to create an A5-size booklet. The pages should be oriented correctly if you select the options "print on both sides of the paper" and "flip on long edge". The booklet is designed such that, if you use a different type of paper for the first page, that novel paper will be used for the cover. I like to use a slightly heavier coloured paper.  Specifically, I use 125 gsm, A4-size, lilac-coloured paper.
